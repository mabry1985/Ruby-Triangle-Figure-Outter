# _Triangle Tracker with Sinatra_

#### _Project for Week 9 at the coding school, Epicodus, written on July 22, 2019._

#### By _**Tae Lee and Josh Mabry**_

## Description

_To get further practice using Sinatra, build a basic application that doesn't need CRUD functionality. Create a Triangle class that includes methods for initializing new triangles and determining triangle type. Keep in mind that not all combinations of three numbers make valid triangles. For example, (2, 2, 8) does not make a triangle.

When unit testing on your Triangle class is complete, make a Sinatra application that lets the user input the lengths of the sides of a triangle and tells whether they form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle.

Here are the Triangle rules you'll need:

Equilateral: all sides are equal;
Isosceles: exactly 2 sides are equal;
Scalene: no sides are equal;
NOT a triangle: the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
Hint: Only two routes and two views are needed to complete this project:

A route for a user input along with a view that has a form for entering the sides of a triangle.
A route with the method to return the triangle type along with a view to display the result to the user._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _Open terminal and type 'git clone [git link]'_
* _Navigate to project directory using cd in terminal_
* _Open project in text editor (atom .)_
* _Type 'bundle install' in terminal to load Gems_
* _To run tests, type 'rspec' in terminal_

## Specs
| Behavior      | Input         | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------:|
| make a class (Triangle) for triangle tracker logic with method name complete() |
| TDD process with rspec on terminal |
| A route for a user input along with a view that has a form for entering the sides of a triangle. |
| --> writing on triangle.erb under views directory for template |
| --> writing on triangle.erb under views directory for form |
